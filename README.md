# Chat with Website Using RAG Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements a chatbot capable of answering questions based on the content of a website by utilizing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. RAG combines the strengths of information retrieval and generative AI, enabling precise and context-aware responses.

## Features
- Retrieves content from a target website.
- Utilizes a retriever model to fetch relevant content.
- Employs a generator model for context-aware responses.
- Provides an interactive chat interface.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Required Libraries
Install the required Python packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes:
- `transformers`
- `faiss`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `requests`
- `flask` (or `streamlit` for web interface)
- `torch` (if using PyTorch-based models)

## How It Works
1. **Website Scraping:**
   - The `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries are used to scrape content from the target website.
   - The scraped text is preprocessed and stored in a vector database.

2. **Vector Database:**
   - `FAISS` is employed for efficient similarity search and retrieval of relevant text snippets.

3. **RAG Pipeline:**
   - A retriever model fetches the most relevant documents based on the user query.
   - A generator model, such as GPT-based or similar, generates a response using the retrieved context.

4. **Chat Interface:**
   - A simple web-based interface (Flask or Streamlit) enables users to interact with the chatbot.

## Usage

1. **Scrape Website Content:**
   Run the script to scrape and preprocess the target website:
   ```bash
   python scrape_website.py --url <website_url>
   ```

2. **Build Vector Database:**
   Process the scraped data and create a FAISS index:
   ```bash
   python build_index.py
   ```

3. **Run the Chatbot:**
   Launch the chatbot interface:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Access the chatbot at `http://localhost:5000` (for Flask) or the provided URL (for Streamlit).

## Customization
- **Retriever Model:** Replace with a different model by modifying `retriever.py`.
- **Generator Model:** Use any generative model supported by `transformers`.
- **UI Framework:** Swap Flask with Streamlit or another framework for customization.

## Limitations
- Performance depends on the quality of the scraped website content.
- May require fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multiple websites.
- Integrate advanced preprocessing for structured data.
- Implement authentication for secure chatbot usage.
